# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type is exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun" # assigns the days of the week to days
months = "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug" # \n starts the things after \n and before the next \n on a new line

print("Here are the days: ", days)# prints the string inbtween " " and then prints out the variable days the comma is required to seperate the string and the variable
print("Here are the months: ", months) #^^^^

print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
""") # prints string on multiple lines
